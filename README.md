# Cervical Cancer Detection from PAP-Test(smear) results using DL
### Overview 
A deep learning framework for cervical cancer detection to allow improved accuracy for PAP smear test results

### Brief Summary
As part of an ETH project a deep learning framework is developed for cervical cancer detection and classification based on microscopics images of cells from PAP smear results. The purpose of this project is to provide another tool for doctors to fast detect if a patient has developed or is in danger of developing cervical cancer.

### Dataset
The model will be trained on the Sipakmed which is a new Dataset for Feature and Image Based Classification of Normal and Pathological Cervical Cells in Pap Smear Images (https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-boundaries-of-the-cytoplasm-and-the-nucleus-of-each-cell-in-images-of-cell-clusters_fig1_327995161)
